演算美學實驗室｜專注於演算美學與表演藝術之深度對話，三大主軸分別為「偽編舞」、「仿山水」、「人工美」。

Computing Aesthetics Lab engages in interdisciplinary studies between algorithmic aesthetics and performing arts. The “pseudo-choreography” project, simulated by fluid and flocking simulation, focuses on digital performance that integrates dance, computer graphics, animation and interactive technologies. The “imitations of Shan-Shui” project, inspired by Oriental aesthetics such as Chinese painting and Nihonga painting, focuses on oceanscape, cloudscape and landscape simulation based on atmospheric and volumetric rendering. “The Artificial Beauty and Sublime” project aims to create micro and immersive serenity with help of AI technologies such as generative adversarial networks.
